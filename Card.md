#### Card

The card is the building block of the unified UI Principle



## Unified Card Theory

### What's a card

#### The card as the CardStrip Blockchain Cornerstone



#### Card Principles

Everything is a card

Every card has an id

Every card has a title

Every card has a position

Every card has a type

Every card has a flag is done

Every card has a value

Every card has options

Every card has a state

Every card state has a hash

Every card has a history of state hashes

Every card can have a hierarchy

Every card can have none, one or multiple children

Every card can have none, one or multiple parents

Every card is a vertical application

Every card should do one thing and one thing only

Every card when done cannot do that one thing only anymore

Every card type is a smartcontract

Every card type has a hash

Every card type can be compiled

Every card state can be serialized into its card type

Every card type has one or more actions

Every card type when having more than one action must define those actions into a workflow so that at anytime only action can be called by the card

Every card type action should be a pure function

Every card type action execution leads to a new card state



### A modern take on workflows

#### Smartcontract leads to card hierarchies

#### Card hierarchies leads to card states

#### Card actions leads to card state changes

#### Card state changes lead to blockchain transactions

#### Blockchain transactions leads to blockchain blocks
