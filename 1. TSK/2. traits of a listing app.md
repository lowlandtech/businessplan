People love to collect things, making lists, grouping things, sorting and filtering things. Tagging things with information like whats in it, who made it where, or what it costs. Things like people and stuff, and dates and what not.
Organizing random things turns order out of chaos. Turns data into information. 

Application developers often forget that. When you have a listing app and you have one static list like YouTube's list of channels you follow. You cannot do anything of the traits that collectors want to do. Since you can't do anything with them you don't look at them what so ever.
