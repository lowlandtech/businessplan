### What's a plan

Plans after Cards are the second most important concept of the CardStrip Platform. ***So, what's a plan then?***   Well a plan is exactly what is sounds like,  "a plan". 



A plan is something for you to formulate a strategy of things to do in order for you to swiftly and efficiently accomplish your goals. 



A plan is a CardStrip core concept which allows users to define, search, collect, follow, sell and resell every plan available in the CardStrip Market store. 

A plan is a microservice which can be created by a user without any programming knowledge



Plans can be quickly dragged and dropped onto user boards where they will form projects and tasks over the goals timeline. Helping the user experience the joy of expert level planning. In order to the user setup a personal roadmap to achieve whatever goal they set themselves to task granularity of daily, weekly, monthly or even yearly activities. Not only that the user behind the plans you follow will help you personally on your way

Well, the short answer it's a kind of a blueprint or a template to easily create project tasks. Well, that was easy you might think! There's nothing special or even innovative about that. Programs like words and excel have been using templates for decades to start new projects.

Yes, that's true but still these Plans are different. **How are they different?** Because they do not only allow you to start your new projects quickly but they also allow the person behind the Plan to help you along the way to accomplish certain tasks quickly or even do those tasks for you. A Plan can be a carefully orchestrated back and forth dialogue of tasks between you and the publisher. Just to get your tasks done and completing your goals quicker. But it can also be something completely different. **So, you can create some kind of todo list like a project management system? ** It could be used like that, yes! But, that is not all that it could be used for.

**How much does something like that costs?** The price is set by the publisher and may consist of one big payment or a bunch of smaller ones. It all the depends how the smartcontracts behind the Plan has been structured. **So, a Plan is a smartcontract?** It is part of it yes. **Can anyone publish a smartcontract?** Yes and no. Anyone that is part of the CardStrip network and is a holder of strip coins can create and issue smartcontracts with the CardStrip wallet.

**Does publishing requires coding knowledge?** For normal and simple plans, no! Dragging and dropping questions on a board and creating fields to hold customers answers will be enough for the bulk of smartcontracts. But more complex smartcontracts might be more involved and may require c# coding skills. But, in time, I assume there will quickly be Plans by developers to help you overcome that limitation.
