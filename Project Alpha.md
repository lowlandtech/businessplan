Project Playbook

CardStrip, writing the playbook of how to make an **income**

Without have to go anywhere you want to go

Without being stuck in traffic

Without spending the most precious thing any human has unnecessarily; **time**

Travel the world and see the stars from different skies while taking your source of income with you

We don't care who you are, where you're from, what your gender is, what the color of your skin is, what you believe or don't believe in, how much money you have, to what school you went or if you went to school at all, what diplomas you have or not have, what work experience you have or not have, we don't even care how old you are.

We don't care because we believe that **income is universal** and everyone should have the same starting point no matter what. So here are the rules

- Every published task should be one hour worth of work on a senior level and should be properly tagged
- Every published task shall minimally be paid for Î±50 into escrow to be released on delivery
- Delivery should always be one of the following; a git repository, a git branch or a git pull request. Nothing else is acceptable no matter what is put in this repository. So, you don't know git, learn it.
- A task can be anything that fits into a git repository and can be done in the time constraint of an hour



A published task can be picked up by anyone, or even by multiple someone's, there's no bidding, no prequalifying candidates. The ideal CardStrip customer does not care who does the work as long as it gets done, in a timely fashion and meets the requirements as specified in the deliverables at.
