After the dash the issue header was used. This can be anything really as long as it describes what you have done and it should be in present tense. So it could have also been for example `add contribution documentation` instead of what it is now. When this images were added a second commit was made and a different description was used.

Now you are done committing the changes. You can push your changes to the server. When that is done in the issue you can create a merge request. Once your merge request is accepted your changes will be included in the business plan.
