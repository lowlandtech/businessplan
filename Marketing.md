#### Vision board dilemma 

Pinterest, nice to watch from a far but far from nice close close by.

#### Sharing is caring

**Why should we share a CardStrip board?** Because your board represents a smartcontract that you have entered into with yourself. To bestow mean and purpose on one's sense of self we need to accomplish tasks. Achieving something requires goal setting, personal or professional, it does not matter. They are often intertwined. Sharing this on social media can help motivate others to follow their plan towards their goals. Or it can trigger people who are in the position to help you to offer their help in order that you can strengthen your resolve to stay on the chosen path. A board is a visual representation and a reminder of that. If you want to read more on our social media plans click [here](Marketing/Social.Media.md)
